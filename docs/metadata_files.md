ShotMAP Metadata Files
---------------------

ShotMAP can accept user defined metadata, which it applies to the statistical tests it ultimately conducts. The format requirements are simple:

1. It is a tab delimited file
2. The first row is a header row that names each metadata field (no spaces please)
3. The first column is named Sample.Name and contains the file name corresponding to each metagenomic sample
