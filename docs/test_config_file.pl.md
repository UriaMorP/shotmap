test_config_file.pl
===================

Usage:
------

    perl test_config_file.pl --config-file </path/to/configuration/file>

Description:
------------

Conducts unit tests associated with running shotmap on a specific data set and protein family database. Users provide 
the script with a configuration script, as defined [here](config_files.md), and this script conducts unit tests 
associated with running shotmap using the config-file defined parameters.

Note that we expect the unit tests associated with this software to increase over time.
