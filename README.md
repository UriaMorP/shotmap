A Shotgun Metagenome Annotation Pipeline

Overview
--------

Shotmap is a software workflow that functionally annotates and compares shotgun metagenomes. Specifically, it will:

1.  Compared unassembled or assembled metagenomic sequences to a protein family database
2.  Calculate metagenome functional abundance and diversity
3.  Compare metagenomes using a variety of statistical and ecological tools
4.  Identify protein families that differentiate metagenomes

Shotmap manages the information and data associated with this workflow in a relational database and will 
handle the communication with and transfer of data between a database server and a distributed computer cluster (SGE).
